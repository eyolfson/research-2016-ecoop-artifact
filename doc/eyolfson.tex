\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This artifact is based on {\tt ConstSanitizer}, a dynamic program analysis
  tool that detects deep immutability violations through \const{} qualifiers.
  Our tool instruments any code compiled by \texttt{clang} with the
  \texttt{-fsanitizer=const} flag. Our implementation includes both
  instrumentation of LLVM code and a runtime library to support our analysis.
  The provided package includes our tool and all experiments used in our
  companion paper. Instructions are also provided.
\end{abstract}

% ARTIFACT: section on the scope of the artifact (what claims of the paper are
%           intended to be backed by this artifact?)
\begin{scope}
  This artifact includes the full source code for our tool,
  \texttt{ConstSanitizer}, and supports the repeatability of our experiments in
  the companion paper. We encourage users to reproduce our results and use the
  tool in other software projects.
\end{scope}

% ARTIFACT: section on the contents of the artifact (code, data, etc.)
\begin{content}
  The artifact package includes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item a Virtual Machine image with everything included
    \item detailed instructions for using the artifact and for rebuilding it
          from scratch, provided as an {\tt index.html} file.
  \end{itemize}

  To simplify repeatabiliy of our experiments, we provide a QEMU and VirtualBox
  disk image containing a minimal GNU/Linux distribution with all required
  sources for the tool and experiments. The image is based on Arch Linux,
  up-to-date on 2016-04-22. For reference, the Linux kernel version is 4.4.3.
  This image includes a pre-compiled version of our tool available through the
  default \texttt{clang} and \texttt{clang++} commands. The instructions outline
  how to build our tool from scratch, if desired, however it is time consuming.
  All of the experiments, including their sources and dependencies, are
  pre-installed so an internet connection is not required.
\end{content} 

% ARTIFACT: section containing links to sites holding the latest version of the
%           code/data, if any
\begin{getting}
  The latest version of the artifact is available on GitHub:
  {\url https://github.com/eyolfson/research-2016-ecoop-artifact}. The
  \texttt{README} in this repository provides the current links to all artifact
  packages and sources. The sources linked in this \texttt{README} are the
  modified LLVM code for the tool. This repository also contains the scripts for
  running all experiments.
\end{getting} 

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the platforms on which the artifact is known to
%           work, including requirements beyond the operating system such as
%           large amounts of memory or many processor cores
\begin{platforms}
  The artifact is known to work on any platform running QEMU or VirtualBox.
  We highly recommend CPUs with hardware virtualization and at least 2~GiB of
  memory for the Virtual Machine. The scripts themselves depend on Arch Linux,
  or any other variant that has the \texttt{pacman} command.
\end{platforms}
